## 👤 Customer Segmentation Logic

### RFM Scoring
- **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) = (R_Score + F_Score + M_Score)/3**
- Scores combined to create 3 segments:
  - High (RFM > 25)
  - Middle (20 ≤ RFM ≤ 25)
  - Low (RFM < 20)

| RFM Segment | % of Total Customers | % of Accepted Group | % of Revenue |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| High        | 21.8%                | 34%                 | 55.2%        |
| Middle      | 35%                  | 38.2%               | 41.1%        |
| Low         | 43.3%                | 27.8%               | <4%          |
