# [Power BI] IFood Customer Segmentation Analysis

## 📝 Project Summary
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **RFM segmentation** of IFood's customer data to identify high-value segments and assess their interest in a newly proposed **food delivery service**. Insights derived can be utilized for **targeted marketing strategies and channel optimization** for service rollout.



## I. Business Context
- IFood is a retail food company with over **200,000 registered customers** in database and **1 million consumers annually**.
- A new **delivery service** is being considered.
- A survey was conducted with 2,200 randomly selected customers throughout 6 campaigns.

## 📌 Business Question
- Determine **which customers to target for the new delivery service** based on demographic and behavioral data.



## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises three separate Excel files, each representing a key component of customer information at IFood.

- Scope: Analyze **demographics**, **RFM scores**, and **shopping behavior** to segment customers
- Toolset: Power BI



## 👤 Customer Segmentation Logic

1. **About RFM Framework**
RFM is a marketing analysis technique that stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. RFM is used to identify and categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior, how recently and frequently they have made purchases, and the total money spent on those purchases.
- Recency: measures how recently a customer has made a purchase.
- Frequency: measures how often a customer has made purchases.
- Monetary Value: measures the total amount of money a customer has spent on purchases.


2. **RFM Calculation**
In RFM analysis, customers are scored based on three factors (Recency - how recently, Frequency - how often, Monetary - how much), then labeled based on the combination of RFM scores
- **RFM Score = (R_Score + F_Score + M_Score)/3**
- Within this project, RFM scores are combined to create 3 segments:
  - High (RFM > 25)
  - Middle (20 ≤ RFM ≤ 25)
  - Low (RFM < 20)

| RFM Segment | % of Total Customers | % of Accepted Group | % of Revenue |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| High        | 21.8%                | 34%                 | 55.2%        |
| Middle      | 35%                  | 38.2%               | 41.1%        |
| Low         | 43.3%                | 27.8%               | <4%          |
